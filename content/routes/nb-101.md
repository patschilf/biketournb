What if you had the Fundy Bay all to yourself? Just across from the Hopewell Rocks, on the other side of Shepody Bay you’ll get exactly that.

Enjoy the scenery, gaze across vast muddy flats and take all the pictures you can fit on your phone, as you cruise along the coast that is largely part of the [Johnson Mill’s Shorebird Reserve](https://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/where-we-work/new-brunswick/featured-projects/bay-of-fundy/johnsons-mills.html).

A particular highlight unfolds in late summer, when thousands of Sandpipers and other migratory birds stop by at the reserve for a final feast on their way to South America – a journey that is a hundred times the distance of this loop. The Interpretive Centre is a great destination to witness the spectacle. The picnic tables outside the centre also make for a good rest stop half way through your ride.

Cap off your bike day with a [craft beer made in Sackville](https://www.facebook.com/bagtownbrewing/) or hang out in the village’s Waterfowl Park.
