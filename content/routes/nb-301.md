High water has become an annual visitor in the Saint John River Valley between Fredericton and Oromocto. A cow, which was born in the midst of the 2018 flood, inspired the name for this route. Unless you're in a hurry, there is lots to see and experience. Spend your day enjoying the scenery of the Saint John River and rewarding yourself with ice cream, craft beer or home made burgers, all the while cruising along through an entirely flat terrain. If you’ve never gone on an out-of-town trip, make this one your first.

From Fredericton the 44km-long tour takes you to the military town of Oromocto, across the Saint John River, and back to Fredericton on the other side. Along Route 105, the old Trans-Canada Highway, a steady stream of traffic can be expected, however, a wide shoulder is available along the whole stretch to keep cars at a safe distance. The Burton Bridge, a steel construction established in 1972, acts as turning point and is one of the trip highlights – MSN.com recently listed it as one of Canada’s 30 most spectacular bridges. Past Oromocto the Lincoln Trail takes you back to Fredericton.
