Combining the Nashwaak and Gibson Trails you'll travel along paved and unpaved trails and a short section of road. For a longer version of the route, keep following River Road and connect with the Nashwaak Trail after passing the (now closed) Bridge in Penniac. For a shortcut, cross the River in Marysville.
