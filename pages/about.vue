    <p>
      We believe that bicycle touring promotes an active and healthy lifestyle, both physically and mentally. 
      Riding a bike, we travel slow enough to enjoy fresh perspectives on what we thought we knew well, yet 
      fast enough to escape to places we’ve never been – may it be for a day or a week. As tourists in our 
      own homes we support an economy that is driven by local, small and independent businesses.

      Through the exploration and documentation of attractive routes of various distances, we make bicycle 
      touring accessible to New Brunswickers of all experience levels. Utilizing existing infrastructure, 
      we aim to make every ride as safe as possible, following dedicated bike paths and low-traffic roads 
      where available. One route at a time, our goal is to connect communities in every corner of the province.
